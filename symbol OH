Built-in ↓Symbols
This section is largely based on the information originally written by Ray Bornert (http://www.winholdem.net/help/help-formula.html#symbols) and extended to include OpenHoldem-specific symbols.
These symbols take output from the scraper engine, from Table Map parameters, and from your formula functions to derive various bits of data that are useful when instructing the OpenHoldem Autoplayer how to act. The set of symbols got extended over time — not all of them are available for all versions of OpenHoldem. This list reflects the state of the latest version. Some old WinHoldem symbols got never implemented due to lack of documentation and practical relevance. Others got replaced or removed over time. Please refer to the chapter “Outdated Features and Incompatibilities between OpenHoldem and WinHoldem” for more information.
As you already might have noticed some of these symbols are of rather technical nature, A set of several hundred more poker-logical symbols is included in the OpenPPL-library that gets discussed in the seeparate OpenPPL-manual. Both languages can be mixed in nearly any way however, so please read on. Here you will find some valuable symbols that you might be miss in OpenPPL.

Tournament Info
MTT symbols provide you some info about the tournament you currently play. They are most useful forswcisions at the bubble. Each one of these symbols returns the value of the corresponding tablemap-region (e.g. r$mtt_number_entrants, etc.). To make use of these symbols they must be displayed at the table, so that OpenHoldem can scrape them.
Symbol 	Meaning
mtt_number_entrants 	Number of players participating in the tournament
mtt_players_remaining 	Number of players still alive in the tournament
mtt_paid_places 	Number of paid places, useful for decisions at the bubble
mtt_my_rank 	My current place in the tournament depending on stacksize, assuming that all players with smaller stacks bust before me

mtt_smallest_stack 	Smallest stack in the tournament, usually in dollars
Hand Rank
Handrank rates your hand-value, assuming you go preflop allin against N opponents, who hold random cards (N = f$prwin_number_of_opponents). A low handrank means. your hand is good, a high handrank means, that many holdings are a favourit against you. For more info see the chapter about handrank.

handrankp 	2652 / (1+f$prwin_number_of_opponents)
Chairs
Please note OpenHoldem needs to see player-cards in a non-showdown-situation to recognize the userchair and then will lock the chair for stability reasons until the session of the hand. A change in userchair can happen on table-change in MTTs at some casinos and will be handled automatically.
Symbol 	Meaning
userchair 	user chair number (0-9), 0 is usually top right

chairbit$abc 	player “abc” chairbit (1 << chair$abc); 0 if not found
Positions
To avoid problems with fast folds in early position the dealposition-symbols will consider the following players as dealt

    any players who are betting, especially the blinds
    all active players between the blinds and the first user who holds cards, i.e. players who are seated and not sitting out. If one of these players does not hold cards, then OpenHoldem will assume that it is due to very fast folds in early positions.
    the user, if he is seated and holds cards
    any players with cardbacks, especially all players between the user and the dealer.

Symbol 	Meaning
betround 	betting round (1-4) 1=preflop, 2=flop, 3=turn, 4=river
currentround 	synonym for betround
previousround 	the previous betting round (1-3, 1 if the current round is preflop)

dealposition 	your deal position 1 = left to the dealer, usually small blind2 = 2 left to the dealer, usually big blind ... nplayersdealt = dealer. dealposition will not change as players fold. Dealposition does not magically auto-adapt for special cases like a missing small-blind. If you want to figure out chairs better use the more modern chair symbols.
callposition 	your numbered offset from the raising player (who is 0)
dealpositionrais 	the deal position of the raising player (1-10)
betpositionrais 	the bet position of the raising player (1-10)

Probabilities
There are several variations of PrWin (standard, weighted and enhanced), each with several pros and cons. For more info see the chapter about PrWin.
Symbol 	Meaning
prwin 	
the probability of winning this hand (0.000 - 1.000) .
PrWin might assume:

    concrete ranges for your opponents with weightings for each possible holdings if you use enhanced PrWin at the DLL-level.
    simplified, but reasonable ranges if you use weighted PrWin at the formula-level, making use of f$prwin_mustplay, f$prwin_top_clip, f$prwin_willplay and f$prwin_wontplay
    random ranges of your opponents (default), where f$prwin_number_of_opponents specifies the number of opponents for the prwin-simulation to control the over-optimism of this very simple model.

prlos 	the probability of losing this hand (0.000 - 1.000) , assuming random ranges of your opponents
prtie 	the probability of pushing this hand (0.000 - 1.000) , assuming random ranges of your opponents
prwinnow 	probability that all opponents have a lower hand right now, assuming random ranges of your opponents
prlosnow 	probability that any opponents have a higher hand right now random, assuming random ranges of your opponents
random 	number between (0.000-1.000). Value is recalculated each time symbol appears in formula.
randomheartbeat 	random number between (0.000-1.000) for the curren heartbeat. Value is calculated only once in current heartbeat.
Introduced for OpenHoldem 2.1.9
randomround 	random number between (0.000-1.000) for the current round. Value is calculated only once in current round.
randomhand 	random number between (0.000-1.000) for the hand. Value is calculated only once per hand.

potcommon 	the total amount of chips in the middle
potplayer 	the total amount of chips in front of all players

Please note that in a fixed-limit game (default) the bets double up at the turn. This will affect the symbols below. If you play no-limit or pot-limit please make sure that your tablemap detects the game-type correctly.
Symbol 	Meaning
nbetstocall 	total number of additional bets required to call.
nbetstorais 	total number of additional bets required to min raise.(Fixed Limit)
ncurrentbets 	total number of bets currently in front of you.

List Tests
Symbol 	Meaning
listXYZ 	
true if your hand is in named list XYZ
Please note that OpenHoldem 5.x+ supports arbitrary many lists with user-defined names as long as the name starts with “list”. OpenHoldem is no longer restricted to list0..list999.
Poker Values
Symbol 	Meaning
pokerval 	absolute poker value for your 5 card hand
pokervalplayer 	absolute poker value for your 2 card pocket hand only
pokervalcommon 	absolute poker value for the common cards
pcbits 	bit list of where your pocket cards are used in your 5 card hand.
If a certain hand can be made with either one of your cards or with one of the board cards OpenHoldem will first take your card. This can happen only for straights and for kickers for quads. This behaviour may seem counter-intuitive to some people, but got inherited from WinHoldem and kept for backward-compatibility.

    Your hand: JTs
    Board: 789T
    Here you have a straight using “both” of your cards in the top two places. So pcbits will be 0b11000 = 24 here.

npcbits 	number (0-2) of your pocket cards used in your 5 card hand.
As npcbits symbol depends on pcbits, the same word of caution applies to this symbol, too.

Symbol 	Meaning
maxnplayersdealt 	
maximum number of dealt players seen in this session.
Especially meant to distinguish certain gametypes (FR / SH / HU) in tournaments. The alternative symbol nchairs is only partially suitable as it depends only on the tablemap shich might fit to multiple gametypes.

The flags toolbar is used to set internal OpenHoldem flag symbols f0..f19 to on or off. These flags can be used in your formula set to quickly enanble or disable certain functionality. E.g. you could use flag 0 to to tell your bot to use a different starting-hands-chart or to do more conti-betting.

Common Cards
Symbol 	Meaning
ncommoncardsknown 	number of common cards known (normal not highlighted)
(Un)known Cards
Symbol 	Meaning

\strikeout off\uuline off\uwave offnouts 	\strikeout off\uuline off\uwave offthe total number of unseen single cards that if dealt to the board might put your hand in the lead. to be counted as an out, the card must be able to bump your level and your new level must be higher than the resulting common level.
Ray E. Bornerts definition of an out is way too optimistic and nearly unusable (a hand like 72o at a board of AKQ will give you 6 outs, as every 7 and every 2 will bump your handlevel to a pair, which beats high-card ace at the board). To calculate outs in a meaningful way, there is f$mh_nouts in Winngys and HTCs hand-strength-library and there are also some good outs-counters available in the forum. However we had to keep this symbol in the code-base, as some outs-counters are based on nouts and try to discount it in a meanigful way.

Colourcodes
Colourcodes for player-profiling if a casino is not supported by PokerTracker. Can also be used for easy adaption against regulars and other friends.
Symbol 	Meaning
colourcode0..colourcode9 	The scraped colourcode for playerX, depending on the tablemap region r$pXcolourcode. All colourcodes will be transformed to the closest web-safe-colour (216 values). This avoids problems with fuzzy casino-displays and 216 values are more easy to be handled by the end-user.
Betting Action
Betting action symbols depend on game-history, They get updated once per orbit at our turn and can therefore only used at our turn; otherwise they are undefined.
Symbol 	Meaning
lastraisedx (x=1-4) 	which chair was the last to raise in round x
raisbitsx (x=1-4) 	which chairs raised in round x
callbitsx (x=1-4) 	which chairs called in round x

ac_agchair_after 	does the aggressor chair act after me?
ac_preflop_pos 	preflop position of the userchair (SB=1 BB=2 Early=3 Middle=4 Late=5 Dealer=6)
ac_prefloprais_pos 	preflop position of the raiser (SB=1 BB=2 Early=3 Middle=4 Late=5 Dealer=6)
ac_postflop_pos 	postflop position of the userchair (first=1 early=2 middle=3 late=4 last=5)
ac_first_into_pot 	returns true if you are first into the pot (first to act or checked to you)
ac_betposx (x=0-9) 	returns bet position of specified chair
ac_dealposx (x=0-9) 	returns deal position of specified chair
Logging
Symbol 	Meaning
log$YourTextGoesHere 	
When executed, adds your specified text to the autoplayer-trace and to the white box in the GUI.
The symbol will be evaluated to 1.
For example if you have the following f$rais-formula,

##f$rais##
[ betround == 2 && (nsuited == 3 || nstraight == 3) && log$ItLives ]

and you flop a backdoor flush draw, then OpenHoldem will raise and also add the text "ItLives" to the log file, just before the RAIS line. Everytime a log$ symbol is accessed it will be flagged for logging. You can use this to track which part of your formula is to blame for the action taken by OpenHoldem.
figure Images/log$_symbol.png
Note: You want to use the log$ symbol at the end of a logic block, to make sure it only gets flagged when all the previous statements are true.
As the log$-symbols modify the autoplayer-trace they require the autoplayer to be engaged.
MessageBoxes with Info
In addition to logging it might be useful to notify the user at run-time and pause script-execution, mainly in a debugging session. For this usecase OpenHoldem provides a symbol msgbox$TEXT, that — surprise — will show a messagebox with text. As the character-set in symbols is slightly limited the following replacements will take place.

    _B will be replaced by a blank
    _C will be replaced by a comma
    _D will be replaced by a dot
    _N will be replaced by a new-line
    _U will be replaced by a underscore

The symbol msgbox$TEXT will evaluate to 0. An example:

##f$preflop## 
WHEN Others RETURN (Call + msgbox$WOOHOO_NPreflop_Bworks_D) FORCE

ICM calculator
An overview of basic ICM push/fold decisions and how they work with OpenHoldem can be found here: http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=ICM.
UTG in a symbols name does always mean the first player after BB at a full-ring table with 10 players. If less players do actually sit at the table, the first position (UTG) will be ignored and the first player will be named UTG+1 (or UTG+2, etc.).
The ICM symbols will always assume, that you win against the player with the smallest stack or lose against the player with the biggest stack of the remaining non-folded players (or against N players with the N smallest stacks), so the ICM-symbols will be slightly too pessimistic in multiway-situations. For headsup (including blind-battle) and against concrete players (e.g. icm_alliwinUTG ) the symbols are accurate.

Hand multiplexor
The purpose of the hand multiplexor is to transfer control to a specific named formula based on your actual 2 card hand. Note that the X’s and x’s are not case sensitive.
Symbol 	Meaning
f$$X 	Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card
f$$XX 	Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card and second card
f$$XXx 	Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card, second card and suited/unsuited state
The X’s in the three symbols will be substituted with your actual hand values at time of evaluation. The first "X" will contain the the rank of your highest hole card, the second "X" will contain the rank of your lowest hole card, and the third "x" will contain either a "s" or "o" depending if your hole cards have the same suit or not. The $$ will be replaced with a single dollar sign. For example, if my hole cards are AhKh, then "f$$X" will result in "f$A" upon evaluation. Similarly, "f$$XX" would result in "f$AK" and "f$$XXx" would result in "f$AKs".
OpenHoldem will then evaluate the corresponding user defined function and return that value for the hand multiplexor symbol. If there is not a corresponding UDF defined for a given set of hole cards, then the return result is zero, not an error. The values returned by the hand specific UDFs are entirely defined by you; one simple suggestion is to have them return 1 for call and 2 for raise; if you do this then your raise formula can do this:

|| [ f$$XXx >= 2 ] //hand specific formula calc

Memory Symbols
The purpose of these symbols is to provide storage for values in order to reuse them at some later time. They once got invented as a substitute for left-hand-side-expressions (assignments of variables), that did not exist in the WinHoldem-scripting-language, but in reality, this is a bit a kludge???. A much better choice for LHS expressions is Perl or via the user-DLL extension. Please see the {Memory Symbols} section for more information.
Symbol 	Meaning
me_st_ 	
Stores a value. Example: me_st_abc_123_45 - stores the value "123.45" in variable "abc".Use "_" for the decimal in values.
Allowed right hand side expressions are:

    numbers, e.g. me_st_Pi_3_141
    symbols, e.g. me_st_MyChair_userchair
    functions, e.g. me_st_CallFunction_f$call
    memory symbols, e.g. me_st_OldValue_me_re_CurrentValue

me_re_ 	Retrieves a previously stored value. Example: me_re_abc - retrieves the value from variable "abc".
me_inc_ 	Increments a memory_symbol by 1. It is used mostly for keeping a running counter of events that happen one at a time.
Hand Symbols
You can reference your dealt hand (hole cards) directly by using the $ symbols. The general form of the $ hand symbols are: $RRs. The $ character is required, followed by 1 or 2 standard card rank characters. The hand symbols are not case sensitive. A,K,Q,J,T,9-2 or by X or x which is a wild card that will match any rank. This is followed by an optional suit indicator: s - suited, o - offsuit. If the suit indicator is omitted then suit does not matter.
Examples:
Symbol 	Meaning
$AA 	true if you were dealt aces
$JT 	true if you were dealt jack ten
$AKs 	true if you were dealt ace king suited
$49o 	true if you were dealt four nine offsuit
$QXs 	true if you were dealt queen any suited
$J 	true if you were dealt any jack
$XXs 	true if you were dealt any suited hand
$XXo 	true if you were dealt any offsuited hand
$q2 	true if you were dealt queen two
Card Symbols
The actual card value or rank/suit value for both your hand and the board can be referenced using card symbols. The general form of the $$ card symbols are: $$AB#. The card symbols are not case sensitive. $$ is required. A - is p for player, c for common B - is c for card, r for rank, s for suit # - is the card number (player 0-1 for Holdem and 0-3 for Omaha, common 0-4)
Examples
Symbol 	Meaning
$$pc0 	the card value for player card zero (1st dealt card)
$$pr3 	the rank value of player card three (4th dealt card, Omaha)
$$ps0 	the suit value for player card zero (1st dealt card)
$$cc0 	the card value of common card zero (1st common card dealt)
$$cr1 	the rank value of common card oneo (2nd common card dealt)
$$cs4 	the suit value of common card four (5th common card dealt - river)
Card Values
The rank values are 2..14 for 2..ace (high), the suit values are 0..3 (indentical to the values of the poker-eval-library) and -1 for undefined. Again the representations of cards are the same as the ones used by the internally used by the poker-eval-library, plus 253..255 for cardback / no-card / undefined.
Ranks
# 	CardRank
14 	Ace
13 	King
